Enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in Windows 11 allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your Windows operating system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open Windows Features

Open the Start Menu and type "Windows Features" to find the "Turn Windows features on or off" option.

2. Enable "Windows Subsystem for Linux"

Scroll down the list and check the box next to "Windows Subsystem for Linux."

This step will install the necessary components to support a Linux environment on your Windows machine. You might need to restart your computer after enabling this feature.

3. Enable "Virtual Machine Platform"

In the same list, find and check the box next to "Virtual Machine Platform."

This feature is required for WSL 2, which offers better performance and compatibility than the original WSL.

4. Open PowerShell as Administrator

Press "Windows + X" and select "Windows Terminal (Admin)" or "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu.

5. Install WSL

Type the command wsl --install and press Enter.

This command will download and install the latest version of WSL, including the default Linux distribution, which is usually Ubuntu.

6. Set WSL 2 as Default

To set WSL 2 as the default version, type the command wsl --set-default-version 2 and press Enter.

This ensures that any future Linux distributions you install will use the WSL 2 architecture.

7. Restart Your Computer

Restart your computer to complete the installation process.
